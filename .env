# Model Configuration
RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD= .22 # Recognition threshold value (range: 0 to 1).  
    # Recommended values: 0.17 to 0.22 for low-resolution cameras, 0.35 to 0.45 for high-resolution cameras.
TRACK_CONFIDENCE=0.5 # Sets the minimum confidence threshold for detections. 
    # Objects detected with confidence below this threshold will be disregarded.
    # Adjusting this value can help reduce false positives.
TRACK_IOU=0.45 # Intersection Over Union (IoU) threshold for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).
    # Lower values result in fewer detections by eliminating overlapping boxes, useful for reducing duplicates.
    # You might need to adjust between 0.45-0.55 based on:
    # * Camera resolution
    # * Face sizes in frame
    # * Lighting conditions
    # * Processing performance requirements
TRACK_MAX_DET=55 #	Maximum number of detections allowed per image.
    # Limits the total number of objects the model can detect in a single inference, preventing excessive outputs in dense scenes.

# Camera Retry Settings
MAX_RETRIES=3 # Maximum number of retries to attempt when connecting to the camera.
RECONNECT_DELAY=1 # Delay in seconds between reconnection attempts.
RECONNECT_INTERVAL=15 #
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES=100 #
